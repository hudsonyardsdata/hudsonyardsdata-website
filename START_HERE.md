Click: Create repository
```

**2. Run the Setup Script**

Open your terminal and navigate to this folder:

cd path/to/hudsonyardsdata-website
./complete-github-setup.sh
```

The script will:
- ✅ Initialize git
- ✅ Commit your files
- ✅ Connect to GitHub
- ✅ Push everything
- ✅ Tell you next steps

**3. Enable GitHub Pages**

After the script succeeds:
```
Go to: https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/hudsonyardsdata-website/settings/pages
