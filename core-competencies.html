        <p>Can we please have four buttons with ‚ÄúBolded Text‚Äù as the front, and if clicked, the text on the back appears?</p>

        <p>Leverage cloud computing to process more data faster and relieve bottlenecks caused by legacy systems. CRD teams work with all three major cloud providers (AWS, Azure &amp; GCS), but we typically recommend Google Cloud.</p>

        <p>Efficient Delivery through Apprenticeship</p>

        <p>Upskill your team by nominating them to work with CRD on a special project. We take a friendly and collaborative approach, sharing in the best practices which we acquired through careers in consulting and technology firms. Through apprenticeship, all can learn.</p>

        <p>We take a fit-for-purpose approach to developing new components in a client‚Äôs existing tech stack, augmenting or building anew.  Whether a client needs engineering, statistical, visualization, ML or other DS work, we&#x27;ll use the right tools for each unique problem.</p>

        <p>Specialized Expertise, On-Demand</p>

        <p>Our early clients told us that they struggled to find the right data science and engineering talent before meeting CRD. We have the ability to attract top talent from across the industry, deploy them efficiently in our delivery model, and scale up or down based on our client needs. </p>

        <p>CRD pairs the most talented engineers with a world-class kit of technology and project delivery tools. We help our clients solve critical business problems, focusing on long-term impact through experimentation and the introduction of more data-driven decisions.</p>

        <p>We came from the working levels of the data science industry, growing up the ranks of Software Engineering titles in the Tech hierarchy, and in Consulting, from entry-level to managing large teams. We seek to create a community where seasoned data professionals can apply their skills while continuing to be challenged and growing, all while sharing in the resources and quality standards of the CRD umbrella. See more on our principles at our Medium blog.</p>

        <p>We are accountable to our clients to succeed, so we scope our projects according to our experience delivering comparable efforts in the past. And we hold ourselves to these estimates, because our goal is to create value for our clients in every engagement. This, in our opinion, is the secret to client partnership and CRD‚Äôs long-term success.</p>

        <p>Ready to Accelerate Your Business?</p>
