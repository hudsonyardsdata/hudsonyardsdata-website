## 🚀 Next Steps (Choose Your Path)

### Path A: Quick Deploy (15 minutes)

1. **Upload to GitHub:**
   ```bash
   cd hudsonyardsdata-website
   ./deploy.sh
   ```

2. **Enable GitHub Pages:**
   - Go to repository Settings → Pages
   - Select "GitHub Actions" as source
   
3. **Done!** Site live at `https://YOUR_USERNAME.github.io/hudsonyardsdata-website/`

### Path B: With Custom Domain (2-3 days)

Follow Path A, then:

1. **Configure domain in GitHub:** Add `hudsonyardsdata.com` in Pages settings

2. **Update DNS records** (see DNS_MIGRATION_GUIDE.md):
   - Add 4 A records pointing to GitHub
   - Add www CNAME
   - Keep email MX records for Gmail!

3. **Wait 24-48 hours** for DNS propagation

4. **Cancel Squarespace** once verified

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Architecture
- **Hosting:** GitHub Pages (free, with CDN)
- **Deployment:** GitHub Actions (automatic)
- **Stack:** Pure HTML/CSS (no build process needed)
- **SSL:** Automatic via GitHub Pages
- **Performance:** Fast (static files + CDN)

### Benefits Over Squarespace
✅ Free hosting  
✅ Version control (full history)  
✅ Programmatic updates via git  
✅ No vendor lock-in  
✅ Works with your Sphinx docs workflow  
✅ Full control over HTML/CSS  

### What You're NOT Getting
❌ Visual page builder (you edit HTML directly)  
❌ Built-in contact forms (need to add separately)  
❌ E-commerce features (can add later if needed)  
❌ Dynamic backend (this is static HTML)

## 📚 Documentation Guide

- **New to this?** → Read `QUICK_START.md`
- **Setting up now?** → Read `README.md`
- **Moving domain?** → Read `DNS_MIGRATION_GUIDE.md`
- **Need help?** → Check README troubleshooting section

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Email Preservation
When migrating DNS, you MUST keep these Gmail records:
```
MX      @    aspmx.l.google.com          1
MX      @    alt1.aspmx.l.google.com     5
MX      @    alt2.aspmx.l.google.com     5
MX      @    alt3.aspmx.l.google.com     10
MX      @    alt4.aspmx.l.google.com     10
TXT     @    v=spf1 include:_spf.google.com ~all
```

### Testing Before Going Live
1. Test at `YOUR_USERNAME.github.io/hudsonyardsdata-website/` first
2. Verify all pages load correctly
3. Test on mobile devices
4. THEN point your domain

### Squarespace Cancellation
**Wait until:**
- ✅ Site works at GitHub Pages URL
- ✅ Custom domain DNS has propagated
- ✅ Email still works
- ✅ Site loads at hudsonyardsdata.com with HTTPS

## 🎓 Learning Resources

### For Editing HTML
- HTML basics: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML
- Just change text between tags - it's intuitive!

### For Git
- Git basics: https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-About-Version-Control
- Or just use GitHub's web interface!

### For GitHub Pages
- Official docs: https://docs.github.com/pages
- Troubleshooting: https://docs.github.com/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Test locally first:**
   ```bash
   python3 -m http.server 8000
   # Visit http://localhost:8000
   ```

2. **Use good commit messages:**
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Updated practice areas section"
   ```

3. **Create a staging branch:**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b staging
   # Test changes here before merging to main
   ```

4. **Add Google Analytics:** See README.md for snippet

5. **Regular backups:** Your code is in git (already backed up!)

## 🆘 Common Issues & Solutions

### "Site shows 404"
- Wait 3-5 minutes after first deploy
